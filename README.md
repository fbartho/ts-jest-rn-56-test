# ts-jest react-native test

This project serves to demonstrate that ts-jest, react-native 0.56, and babel are grumpy together even in a hello-world!

I followed the instructions here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native.html

## Extra tweaks

* Added yarn-resolutions to package.json so that we correctly use babel7 over babel6.
